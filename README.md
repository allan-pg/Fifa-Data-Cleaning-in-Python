## Introduction
Welcome to the FIFA Dataset Data Cleaning and Transformation project! This project focuses on cleaning and enhancing the FIFA dataset to ensure it is well-prepared for in-depth analysis. The project involves a comprehensive data cleaning process and transformation of key features to improve data quality and usability.

## About the dataset
- I downloaded the dataset from kaggle and it can be accessed <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yagunnersya/fifa-21-messy-raw-dataset-for-cleaning-exploring/code">here</a>
It consists of all information concerning football players such as player names, age, clubs, nationality, wages, positions, performance ratings, height & weight etc. The raw dataset before cleaning consists of 18979 rows and 76 columns.
